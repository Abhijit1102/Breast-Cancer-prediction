# sklearn-Diabets-Deployment
The sklearn-Diabetes-Deployment project deploys a diabetes prediction model using Flask for efficient disease management.

# ML Project - Flask App

This project is an example of an ML project with a Flask app for deployment. It follows a specific folder structure and component organization.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `src`
  -- `init.py`
  -- `logger.py`
  -- `exception.py`
  -- `utils.py`
  -- `components`
  --  `init.py`
  -- `data_ingestion.py`
  -- `data_transformation.py`
  -- `model_trainer.py`

- `pipelines`
  -- `init.py`
  -- `predict_pipeline.py`
  -- `train_pipeline.py`

- `import_data.py`
- `setup.py`
- `notebooks`
- `requirements.txt`

The `src` directory contains the main source code files for the ML project. It includes the `logger.py` file for logging, the `exception.py` file for handling exceptions, and the `utils.py` file for utility functions.

The `components` directory contains the core components of the ML project. It includes the `data_ingestion.py` file for loading data, the `data_transformation.py` file for data preprocessing and splitting, and the `model_trainer.py` file for training a machine learning model.

The `pipelines` directory contains the pipeline scripts for executing the data processing and model training steps. It includes the `predict_pipeline.py` file for making predictions using the trained model and the `train_pipeline.py` file for running the entire training pipeline.

The `import_data.py` script is used to import data into the project. The `setup.py` file contains the project setup details, and the `notebooks` directory is for storing Jupyter notebooks related to the project. The `requirements.txt` file lists the required dependencies for the project.

## Deployment as Flask App

To deploy the ML project as a Flask app, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

arduino
Copy code

2. Ensure that you have the Flask framework installed. If not, install it by running:
pip install flask

markdown
Copy code

3. Create a Flask app file, e.g., `app.py`, at the root of the project directory. In this file, you can define the Flask routes and use the ML components to handle requests and provide predictions.

4. Run the Flask app using the following command:
flask run

csharp
Copy code

5. Access the deployed Flask app in your web browser by visiting `http://localhost:5000` or the URL provided in the Flask output.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use and interact with your Flask app. Include any necessary details on input formats, endpoint URLs, and any additional requirements.

## Contributing

Specify how others can contribute to your project if desired.

## License

Include the license information for your project.

## Acknowledgements

Mention any acknowledgements or references for resources, code snippets, or frameworks used in your project.

Feel free to customize this README file to match the specifics of your ML project and Flask app deployment.

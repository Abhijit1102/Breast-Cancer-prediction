#  End-to-End Modular Machine Learning Breast Cancer Prediction Project

## Project Description

The End-to-End Modular Machine Learning Breast Cancer Prediction Project is a comprehensive solution designed to accurately classify breast cancer cases with an impressive classification accuracy of 99.45%. Following industry standards, the project encompasses various modules that work together seamlessly to provide a robust and efficient prediction system.

## Project Structure

The project follows a specific folder structure:

- `notebook` directory: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `src` directory: Contains the main source code files for the ML project.
    - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the `src` package.
    - `logger.py`: Provides logging functionality for the project.
    - `exception.py`: Handles exceptions that may occur during the execution.
    - `utils.py`: Contains utility functions used throughout the project.
    - `components` directory: Contains the core components of the ML project.
        - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the `components` package.
        - `data_ingestion.py`: Handles data loading and preprocessing.
        - `data_transformation.py`: Performs data transformation and feature engineering.
        - `model_trainer.py`: Trains the machine learning model.
- `templates` directory: Contains HTML templates for the Flask web application.
- `pipelines` directory: Contains pipeline scripts for executing data processing and model training steps.
    - `__init__.py`: Initialization file for the `pipelines` package.
    - `predict_pipeline.py`: Executes the pipeline for making predictions using the trained model.
    - `train_pipeline.py`: Executes the pipeline for training the machine learning model.
- `import_data.py`: Script for importing data into the project.
- `setup.py`: Project setup file.
- `notebooks` directory: Contains additional Jupyter notebooks related to the project.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the required dependencies for the project.

## Deployment as Flask App

To deploy the ML project as a Flask app, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`


3. Create a Flask app file, e.g., `application.py`, at the root of the project directory. In this file, you can define the Flask routes and use the ML components to handle requests and provide predictions.

4. Run the Flask app using the following command:
- `python application.py`


5. Access the deployed Flask app in your web browser by visiting `http://localhost:5000` or the URL provided in the Flask output.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use and interact with your Flask app. Include any necessary details on input formats, endpoint URLs, and any additional requirements.

## Contributing

Specify how others can contribute to your project if desired.

## License

Include the license information for your project.

## Acknowledgements

Mention any acknowledgements or references for resources, code snippets, or frameworks used in your project.

Feel free to customize this README file to match the specifics of your ML project and Flask app deployment.
